										<h1>About Me - Biography and Work Experiences</h1>

									<p>John Henry, Paul Bunyon and other legends from tall tales were always said to be born with a hammer, axe, etc in their hands. I wasn't as lucky but I was on my first computer at 18 months. Luckily my Dad worked for Ford and we were given a free home desktop, and my Mom took programming classes back when she was in high school (fortran and cobol). I spent much of my youth tinkering, playing on computers, exploring, and building robots.</p>
									<p>Starting in kindergarten every year I would go to basketball camp, soccer camp and then my favorite robotics camp. We'd spend a whole week creating really simple robots to follow lines, do battle bots, create chain reaction machines, etc. By the time I was entering middle school I had already been working with robots for 5 years. My middle school has an after school robotics club that would meet in the library twice a week. It was a great time and it kept me hooked. My love of technology continued into high school as I switched between schools and programs. My Senior year I was able to explore lots of different career options between auto tech, tv broadcasting, PHP/Web Dev and C#/Java programming.</p>
									<p>I feel that without my programming teachers I had, I would not be the well rounded programmer I am today. Both teachers encoraged me to explore, try advanced problems from projecteuler.net, work on solo projects and finally they convinced me to join the High School robotics team. I also particpated in BPA that year and placed 3rd nationwide for C# and Java programming. When I graduated I went straight to college sure that I wanted to become a software developer. I quickly learned this wasn't the path for me, but I still was in love with programming. I would do contracting work, odds and ends web development for friends/family and just continued to go to school for programming.</p>
									<p>I began to work more serious jobs focusing on robotics with The Robot Garage as an Instructor, Designer and Lead. I would work with students k-8 to teach them engineering principles, programming basics and working with Ev3 robots. I kept looking for more industry related work and found a Job with Autoguide Mobile Robots. I began as a service technician but quickly become a Jr. Developer/Tester. I wrote my first major program in the form of an HMI (Human Machine Interface) for the Mylo Tugger Robots using JavaFX. The program had to communicate with a series of programs that actually controlled the robot and display the information in useful ways. The robot had a touch screen so we also had menus, debug tools, logging, pin codes, etc that had to be included. It was a great experience for me to learn so much about testing, development and deployment. Eventually I left Autoguide to pursue teaching Mechatronics and Java programming.</p>
									<p>Since becoming a teacher in 2017 I have continued to work side jobs, practice my skills, work on projects for different companies like RGGI, Yellow Fox, Mino Automation, TRG, GorillaCrypto, GreenCrate and others. My current projects are mainly robotics focused using ROS and Embedded Linux machines like the Jetson Nano/Xavier. I have learned over 20 programming languages, experienced 4 different types of businesses. I have worked in sales, troubleshooting, research and development, rapid prototyping, customer support, project management, and most recently as a Senior Engineer overseeing the development of the Wanda Series Robots.</p>
